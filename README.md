This is a properties file that can be inserted into the game files of Farming Simulator 22 so that the PowerA Nintendo Switch Pro wired controller can be recognized by the game with the right default button and logic mappings.

The PowerA Nintendo Switch Pro wired controller is a fantastic after-market low-cost controller to use both on the Nintendo Switch, Mac, or PC.

I tried using this controller initially to play Farming Simulator 22 on my Mac at home, but ran into a huge problem that set me back for days.

Farming Sim 22 would not recognize the controller almost at all. Then, when it would recognize, all of the button mappings didn't saying things like "X, Y, etc..." They said "Button 12, 13, etc..."

How was I supposed to know which button did what?

After digging in the source files of the game, I found where all the controller mappings for each controller, manufacturer, and model were stored. Of course, there was no such file for the controller I bought, so I decided to make one. This is the file.
